This project focuses on building a particle system animation in openFrameworks. It begins with rendering textures from a particle pack and writing a shader to alter their grayscale appearance into effects such as fire, lightning, or other visuals. A particle system is then developed to render multiple particles simultaneously, using a custom implementation of the Particle and ParticleGenerator classes. Each particle tracks its own lifespan and updates its position and attributes over time, while the generator respawns new particles with randomized properties such as position, velocity, and lifetime. The system makes use of blending modes like additive or alpha to achieve the desired visual style, and particles are drawn and updated individually within the main application loop.

The project expands by adding features that enhance realism and variety. Particles fade in at spawn, hold intensity, and fade out as they die, creating seamless transitions. Randomized velocities with optional acceleration or deceleration give particles more natural movement. Multiple textures are incorporated so that particles can vary in appearance, reducing visual repetition. A second complementary particle system is also introduced, designed to contrast with the first by using different textures and a different blending mode
