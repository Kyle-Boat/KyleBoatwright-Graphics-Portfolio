This project serves as a technical showcase focused on billboarding techniques inspired by classic Doom-style rendering. Billboarding ensures that 2D objects always face the camera, creating the illusion of 3D while keeping rendering costs low. To push the system further, frustum culling was implemented to optimize performance by only rendering objects within the cameraâ€™s visible field of view. This allowed the scene to be stress-tested with a large number of billboards while maintaining smooth performance. The result is a demonstration of efficient rendering strategies that balance visual fidelity with real-time performance, highlighting the use of retro-inspired techniques in modern graphics programming.
