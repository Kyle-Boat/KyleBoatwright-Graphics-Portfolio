This project explores 3D terrain rendering using heightmaps, level of detail techniques, and atmospheric effects. The process begins by writing a function to convert a 2D heightmap image into a 3D terrain mesh, where pixel intensity determines vertex height. The resulting mesh is rendered with perspective projection, directional and ambient lighting, and camera navigation controls for free exploration of the environment.

The terrain is extended into an immersive open-world experience by supporting multiple levels of detail. At a distance, a low-resolution version of the heightmap is rendered for efficiency, while high-resolution terrain chunks are dynamically loaded as the camera moves closer. This system is managed by a CellManager class, which handles streaming of terrain data to balance performance with visual fidelity. To enhance realism, the project includes a water plane at a fixed world elevation, visually distinguishing land from water regions.


Additional rendering techniques improve both visuals and immersion. Normals are computed and shaded with Lambertian diffuse lighting to create the effect of sunlight across the terrain, while gamma correction ensures accurate color representation. Alpha blending is introduced to provide fog and to seamlessly transition between high and low detail terrain, preventing harsh visual seams. The final result is a navigable 3D world with scalable terrain rendering, efficient performance, and atmospheric depth.
