This project explores advanced environment illumination techniques through texture mapping, reflections, and physically based specular shading in openFrameworks. The first stage focuses on building a richly lit scene with textures. A skybox provides environmental context, while objects and surfaces are textured with diffuse color maps, normal maps, and optionally ambient occlusion maps. Textures are optimized with mipmapping, and an irradiance map is applied to ensure ambient lighting remains consistent with the skybox. Multiple light sources illuminate the scene alongside ambient light, with shaders carefully gamma-corrected for accurate color representation.

The second stage expands on this foundation by introducing specularity and reflection. The object is given materials that reflect the skybox and respond to dynamic light sources with highlights. Fresnel reflections are implemented using Schlick’s approximation, producing more realistic reflection intensity at glancing angles. For specular highlights, the Cook-Torrance microfacet model is implemented with GGX distribution, Smith masking-shadowing, and Schlick’s Fresnel, bringing the scene into line with modern physically based rendering practices. This results in surfaces that accurately distinguish between metallic and non-metallic materials, with realistic reflections and highlights based on both environment and direct light.


The final scene combines skybox-based reflections, multi-light shading, and physically based specularity into an immersive environment. Whether applied to terrain, water, or detailed 3D models, this project demonstrates how texture mapping and advanced shading models can work together to create dynamic, high-fidelity real-time graphics.
