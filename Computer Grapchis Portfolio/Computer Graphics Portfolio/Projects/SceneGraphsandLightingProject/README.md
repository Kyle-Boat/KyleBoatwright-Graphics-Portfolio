This project explores hierarchical modeling and real-time lighting by constructing and animating a robot using scene graphs in openFrameworks. The robot is built from primitive meshes such as cubes, cones, cylinders, spheres, and toruses, organized into a hierarchical structure that defines how each part relates to the whole. A scene graph is used to manage transformations and parent-child relationships, making it possible to animate components relative to one anotherâ€”for example, arms attached to a rotating torso or wheels attached to a moving base.

The scene is enhanced with multiple dynamic light sources. Three discrete lights are introduced, including point lights and spotlights, each with physically correct attenuation for realistic falloff. Ambient light is also added for baseline illumination, and gamma correction ensures accurate color rendering. The placement and configuration of these light sources make the robot clearly visible while also demonstrating the interplay of directional effects and shading.


Finally, the robot is brought to life through animation. Multiple components are animated simultaneously, with at least one animated node acting as the parent of another, creating compound hierarchical motion. A custom update function is written for one of the nodes to demonstrate flexibility beyond simple transformations, while one of the light sources itself is integrated into the scene graph as an animated node, casting dynamic illumination as it moves. Together, these elements result in a fully realized interactive scene that combines hierarchical modeling, real-time lighting, and animation into a cohesive visual system.
